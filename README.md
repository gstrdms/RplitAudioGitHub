# RplitAudioGitHub

This is my first real forray into GitHub and version control. I decided to start off with a small set of Replit projects that would allow me to get a grasp on GitHub by working on several small projects that would require a progressively more involved approach.

This project in particular is a replica of their Python Audio Player tutorial. I thought it would be a good place to start because it's relatively accessible and would be a quick way to get a little GitHub workout by trying to modify and expand on the player's functionality and features beyond what the tutorial requires.
